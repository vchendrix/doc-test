The S1 bog was harvested in successive strip cuts in 1969 and 1974 and the cut areas were allowed to naturally regenerate. Stations 1 and 2 are located in a 1974 strip that is characterized by a medium density of 3-5 meter black spruce and larch trees with an open canopy. The area was suitable for siting a monitoring station for representative meteorological conditions on the S1 bog. Station 3 is located in a 1969 harvest strip that is characterized by a higher density of 3-5 meter black spruce and larch trees with a generally closed canopy. Measurements at this station represent conditions in the surrounding stand. Site Photographs are in the attached document",
