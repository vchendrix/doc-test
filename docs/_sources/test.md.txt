### 1. ESS-DIVE OVERVIEW

Click the link to the ESS-DIVE data portal: https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/

By default, you will see the ESS-DIVE homepage (Figure 2). You will see three main sections - a search bar on the left (see Section 3), a dataset listing in the middle, and a map on the right. 

By default, you will see all public data packages on ESS-DIVE. If you wish to view your unpublished data packages, or to download data, click on the “Sign in with Orcid” button in the top right corner. Login with your ORCID credentials.

Figure 2 ESS-DIVE Data portal home screen.

You will see the citation for a data package, which is in the form: Authors (Publication Date): Dataset Title. Project. DOI or ESS-DIVE ID. 


Figure 3 ESS-DIVE Dataset Citations

There are various symbols that appear beneath the data citation (not all of them appear on all the datasets). Tooltips appear if you hover over the icon. This is what they mean:
Orange Lock Icon: The record is unpublished, and only visible to you. If the lock is not visible, it means the data package is public and can be viewed by anyone.
Cloud Icon: This is the link that you should click to download files. It will appear blue if the data can be downloaded, and gray if you don’t have access to download the data.
The number with the eye icon: This refers to the number of views this dataset has received. 
Info icon: Shows a preview of the abstract.
Files icon: Indicates whether there are any data files associated with the package. If this icon is not visible, it means only metadata are available for the data package. 
Map marker icon: Refers to how many other datasets are associated with that location.

You can get choose to hide Map by clicking on the Hide Map link (Figure 4), which will allow you to view more listings on your web page (Figure 5).
